# Weighted Graph

An implementation of weighted graph in java

### Node Data class

* NodeData hold node's information
key, location, tag, info and weight.

* There is a getters and setters for all but the key for him there is just a getter.

### Edge Data class

* EdgeData hold edge's information
src node key, dest node key, tag, info and weight.

* There is a getters for all and setter for the tag and info.

### Geo Location class

* GeoLocation is a 3D point. Every point have x, y, and z.

* `distance()` return the distance between two points

### Directed Weighted Graph class

* WGraph_DS holds two hashmaps.
the first is for the nodes - the key is the key of the node, 
and the value is the node himself.
the second is for the edges - the key is a node key,
and the value is a hashmap of all his neighbors.

* `addNode()` add a given node to the graph
`getNode()` return the node with given key

* `getEdge()` return the edge between two givens nodes.

* `connect()` make a new edge between two nodes with a given weight.
if there is an edge already the method simply update the weight.

* `removeEdge()` simply delete the edge between two givens nodes.
`removeNode()` delete the node from the graph and delete all the edges that connected to him 
by using `removeEdge()`.

* `getV()` the method simply return a collection of all the nodes in the graph.
`getE(key)` return a collection of all the neighbors of a specific node.

* `nodeSize()` return the number of nodes in the graph

* `edgeSize()` return the number of the edges in the graph

### Directed Weighted Graph Algorithm class

* WGraph_Algo holds a graph, all the algorithms works on the graph.

* there are two constructors, one without a given graph and one with a given graph.

* the method `init()` change the class's graph to a given graph.
`getGraph()` return the class's graph.

* `copy()` make a deep copy of the class's graph and return him.

* `isConnected()` return true if the graph is strongly connected and false if not.

* the method `shortestPathDist()` return the shortest path distance between two givens nodes.
 the method `shortestPath()` return a list of the shortest path between two givens nodes.
 
* the method `save()` simply save the class's graph to given file in json format.
 the method `load()` simply load a graph to the class's graph from a given json file.
  

#### Adapters classes

* for the NodeData, EdgeData and WGraph_DS there are serialize to json format and deserializers from json format

* NodeData format: { "pos": "x,y,z", "id": int }

* EdgeData format: { "src": int, "w": double, "dest": int }

* WGraph_DS format: { "Edges: [edge, edge, edge]", "Nodes": [node, node, node] }
